This project provides a web-based calculator to help developers estimate and compare fees under different Apple App Store commission structures, including the new terms introduced in 2024.

## Project Overview

The App Store Fee Calculator allows developers to input their app's financial details and receive a breakdown of fees under various scenarios. It takes into account different fee structures, including existing terms, alternative terms, and their variations with link-out options.

## Features

- Calculate fees under four different scenarios:
  1. Existing terms
  2. Existing terms with link-out
  3. Alternative terms
  4. Alternative terms with link-out
- Consider Small Business Program eligibility
- Account for Core Technology Fee (CTF) in alternative terms
- Visualize fee breakdowns with a stacked bar chart
- Responsive web design for ease of use on various devices

## Calculations

The calculator performs the following fee calculations:

1. Existing Terms:
   - Standard: 30% of developer's in-app revenue
   - Small Business Program: 15% of developer's in-app revenue
